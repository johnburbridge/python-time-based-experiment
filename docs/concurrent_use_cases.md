# Concurrent Access Use Cases

## Real-World Scenarios

### 1. Event Processing System
- **Scenario**: Multiple services processing events from different sources
- **Example**: A system receiving events from:
  - User actions (web interface)
  - IoT devices
  - External API integrations
  - Background jobs
- **Concurrency Needs**:
  - Multiple writers adding events simultaneously
  - Readers querying events while new ones arrive
  - No data loss or corruption

### 2. Time Series Database
- **Scenario**: High-frequency data collection and analysis
- **Example**: Monitoring system collecting:
  - Server metrics
  - Application performance data
  - User activity logs
- **Concurrency Needs**:
  - Multiple collectors writing data
  - Analytics jobs reading historical data
  - Real-time dashboards querying recent data

### 3. Event Scheduler
- **Scenario**: Distributed task scheduling system
- **Example**: System managing:
  - Background jobs
  - Scheduled reports
  - Periodic maintenance tasks
- **Concurrency Needs**:
  - Multiple workers scheduling tasks
  - Task executors checking for due tasks
  - Admin interface viewing/managing schedules

### 4. Log Aggregation System
- **Scenario**: Centralized log collection and analysis
- **Example**: System collecting logs from:
  - Multiple applications
  - Different environments
  - Various services
- **Concurrency Needs**:
  - Multiple log sources writing simultaneously
  - Log analysis tools reading data
  - Real-time monitoring systems

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Thread Safety
- Safe concurrent access from multiple threads
- No race conditions during:
  - Event insertion
  - Event deletion
  - Range queries
  - Duration queries

### 2. Performance Considerations
- Minimize lock contention
- Allow concurrent reads when possible
- Efficient write operations
- Scalable under high concurrency

### 3. Consistency Levels
- Strong consistency for critical operations
- Eventual consistency where acceptable
- Clear consistency guarantees

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of concurrent modifications
- Clear error messages for conflicts
- Recovery mechanisms for failed operations

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Lock-Based Synchronization
- Read-write locks for different operations
- Fine-grained locking for better concurrency
- Deadlock prevention strategies

### 2. Lock-Free Data Structures
- Atomic operations where possible
- CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations
- Memory ordering considerations

### 3. Transaction Support
- Atomic operations
- Isolation levels
- Rollback capabilities

### 4. Version Control
- Optimistic locking
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Version tracking for modifications

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Concurrency Tests
- Multiple threads performing operations
- Stress testing under load
- Race condition detection

### 2. Performance Tests
- Throughput under concurrent access
- Latency measurements
- Resource usage monitoring

### 3. Consistency Tests
- Data integrity verification
- Consistency level validation
- Recovery testing

### 4. Edge Cases
- Deadlock scenarios
- Resource exhaustion
- Error conditions
