"""
Time-based storage implementation with both thread-safe and non-thread-safe variants.

Core (non-thread-safe) implementations:
- TimeBasedStorage: Basic time-based storage using a dictionary
- TimeBasedStorageHeap: Heap-based implementation for efficient range queries

Concurrent (thread-safe) implementations:
- ThreadSafeTimeBasedStorage: Thread-safe wrapper around TimeBasedStorage
- ThreadSafeTimeBasedStorageHeap: Thread-safe wrapper around TimeBasedStorageHeap
